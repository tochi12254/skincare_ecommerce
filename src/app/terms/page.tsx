          <p>
            <strong>Our Promise to You:</strong> We are committed to offering
            safe, high-quality skincare products that help you look and feel
            your best. Every product is described as accurately as possible, but
            if something doesnâ€™t seem right, please let us know.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your Well-Being Comes First:</strong> Our products are for
            external use only. Since everyoneâ€™s skin is unique, results may
            vary. We recommend a patch test before use. For sensitive or
            problem-prone skin, consult your dermatologist.
          </p>

            <strong>Shopping With Us:</strong> Orders are secure and payments
            are processed safely using trusted methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Shipping & Delivery:</strong> We work hard to deliver your
            order quickly. Delivery times vary by location. Tracking details are
            provided once your package ships.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Returns & Refunds:</strong> Unopened and unused items may be
            returned within our return period. Refunds are processed promptly
            after we receive your return.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Weâ€™re Here for You:</strong> Our care team is ready to
            assist with product advice, order issues, or general inquiries. You
            can reach us via email, phone, or our contact form.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Privacy & Security:</strong> Your trust matters to us. We
            safeguard your personal information in line with our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
